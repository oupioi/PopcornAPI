## PopCorn API
PopCorn API is a RESTful API designed to power our React Native mobile application. This API allows users to interact with our app and enhances their movie-watching experience. We utilize an external API, The Movie Database (TMDb), for our movie database, providing users with a vast selection of films to explore.

## Features
With the PopCorn API, users of our mobile application can:

Browse a comprehensive list of movies, including the latest releases and popular titles
Search for movies by title, genre, or release year
Retrieve detailed information about specific movies, such as cast, crew, ratings, and plot summaries
Create and manage personal watchlists
Rate and review movies
Access personalized movie recommendations based on their preferences and watch history
Getting Started
To interact with the PopCorn API, users will need to have the React Native mobile application installed on their device. The API endpoints are accessible through the app's user interface, allowing users to seamlessly browse, search, and manage their movie collections.

## External API
PopCorn API leverages The Movie Database (TMDb) for its movie data. TMDb offers a rich and extensive database of movies, with up-to-date information on newly released and upcoming films. By integrating with TMDb, PopCorn API ensures that users have access to a wide variety of high-quality movie data.

## Updates
Please note that this README will be regularly updated as the project progresses. Be sure to check back often for the latest information and features related to the PopCorn API.
